Welcome to ezhost's documentation
==================================

Ezhost is a python package used for make server install and configuration became simple 
and easy. You can find most of the popular server stacks from the documents. For example,
if you want to build your LNMP server (Linux+Nginx+Mysql+PHP), you just need one command and
drink coffee. That's it.
